**#Project Overview**

This project is an IoT solution that facilitates remote device control using an ESP32 microcontroller. The mobile application, built with Flutter, communicates with the ESP32 over Wi-Fi and provides users with the ability to manage connected devices. It features voice command functionality through speech-to-text technology, allowing for hands-free control. Firebase is utilized for real-time updates and device status management.

**#Key Features**

*ESP32 Integration:* Controls devices by interacting with GPIO pins, enabling power switching.

*Voice Control Capability:* Incorporates speech-to-text for seamless, hands-free operation.

*Live Data Updates:* Utilizes Firebase to synchronize data in real-time, ensuring the app and ESP32 remain aligned.

*Mobile App:* Developed using Flutter for a user-friendly and responsive experience.


**#Technologies Used**

*ESP32:* A reliable microcontroller for managing IoT device connectivity and control.

*Flutter:* A framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications.

*Firebase:* Provides real-time database functionality and cloud services.

*Speech-to-Text:* Transforms voice input into text, allowing voice commands to be processed.

**#How to Use**

1. *Set Up the ESP32:* Ensure the ESP32 is powered and connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your mobile device and ESP32 specific GPIO connected to relay module.


2. *Open the App:* Run the app on your mobile device and grant any required permissions for speech-to-text functionality.


3. *Control Your Devices:* Use the app interface or issue voice commands to control the devices.
